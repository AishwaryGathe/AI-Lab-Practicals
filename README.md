# AI Lab Practicals

AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. AI involves developing algorithms and computer programs that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, pattern recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.

AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields, such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision, and expert systems. AI has numerous applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and entertainment, among others, and is rapidly transforming the way we live and work.
