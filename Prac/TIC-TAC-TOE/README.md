# TIC-TAC-TOE

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing their respective symbols (usually X and O) on the grid until one of them achieves a win or the game ends in a draw.

The logic behind the game is to try and create a line of three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal on the grid, while preventing your opponent from doing the same. If you manage to create a line of three, you win the game.

The game is based on simple rules and requires strategic thinking, as each player has to anticipate the moves of their opponent and make their moves accordingly. Since there are a limited number of spaces on the grid, players must also consider their opponents' moves and plan ahead to ensure they don't run out of spaces before achieving a win.

The game can be won in eight different ways - three horizontal, three vertical, and two diagonal lines. The first player to achieve a line of three of their symbols wins the game.

Overall, the logic behind Tic Tac Toe is to outsmart your opponent by planning ahead, anticipating their moves, and creating lines of your symbols on the grid while preventing them from doing the same.
